# AWS-S3-Static-Website-Hosting-using-Terraform

In today’s DevOps world, manually clicking through the AWS Console to create resources is considered an anti-pattern. The modern approach is Infrastructure as Code defining your entire infrastructure in version-controlled files, just like application code.

In this project, I automated the complete setup of a static website hosted on AWS S3 using Terraform. Everything from creating the S3 bucket, configuring public access, enabling website hosting, uploading the HTML files, and attaching a bucket policy was done with a single terraform apply command.
